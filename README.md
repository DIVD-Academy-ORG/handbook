## Meetings
In an Agile work environment, several types of meetings are designed to facilitate communication, collaboration, and continuous improvement. The main meetings include:

### [Daily Standup](#daily-standup)
   - **Purpose:** To quickly synchronize the team, identify obstacles, and plan the work for the day.
   - **Frequency:** Daily
   - **Duration:** Typically 15 minutes
   - **Participants:** The development team, Scrum Master, and optionally the Product Owner.

### [Sprint Planning](#sprint-planning)
   - **Purpose:** To define the work to be completed in the upcoming sprint and establish a plan for achieving the sprint goal.
   - **Frequency:** At the beginning of each sprint
   - **Duration:** 2-4 hours for a two-week sprint
   - **Participants:** The development team, Scrum Master, and Product Owner.

### [Refinement](#refinement)
   - **Purpose:** To review and adjust the product backlog, ensuring that the backlog items are well-understood, appropriately prioritized, and ready for future sprints.
   - **Frequency:** Regularly throughout the sprint (often weekly)
   - **Duration:** Varies (typically an hour or two)
   - **Participants:** The team and Product Owner, with the Scrum Master facilitating if needed.

### [Sprint Review](#sprint-review)
   - **Purpose:** To inspect the increment and adapt the product backlog if needed. It is a demonstration of the work completed during the sprint to gather feedback.
   - **Frequency:** At the end of each sprint
   - **Duration:** 1-2 hours for a two-week sprint
   - **Participants:** The team, Scrum Master, Product Owner, and stakeholders.

### [Sprint Retrospective](#sprint-retrospective)

   - **Frequency:** At the end of each sprint
   - **Duration:** 1-2 hours for a two-week sprint
   - **Participants:** The development team and Scrum Master, with the Product Owner attending optionally.

These meetings help ensure the team stays aligned, addresses issues promptly, and continuously improves its processes and product.



## Project
At DIVD Academy, we proudly collaborate with a diverse array of esteemed partners to drive innovation and excellence across multiple projects. Our mission is to create a collaborative environment where expertise and creativity converge to tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow. These projects are available to our students, trainees, and volunteers.

### [Project website DIVD.academy](#website-academy)
Migrate the existing website from Google Sites to GitHub Pages, ensuring all content and features are transferred, optimized, and fully functional on the new platform. You can find the [project brief here](https://github.com/DIVD-Academy-ORG/website/issues/1) and this is the [projectboard](https://github.com/orgs/DIVD-Academy-ORG/projects/9)

### [Project Digitaal Veilig Den Haag](#project-digitaal-veilig-den-haag)
In a city like The Hague, safeguarding crucial digital data is a top priority, with both the municipality and various organizations, including the newly established DIVD Academy, playing essential roles. Co-founder Astrid Oosenbrug [highlights](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/maak-kennis-met-astrid-oosenburg-digitaal-veilig-den-haag/?trackingId=%2F8GQiyEOIElTEqsGhkqxdQ%3D%3D) the Academy's mission to address inequalities in the IT sector by offering opportunities such as free hacking courses and internships to underrepresented youth, thus enhancing both their prospects and the city's digital security. 

### [Project LearningLion](#project-learning-lion)
Government employees often use external AI tools like ChatGPT for tasks such as writing emails and summarizing documents, but these tools often don't meet stringent data privacy and regulatory standards. SSC-ICT aims to develop a locally controlled Dutch language model using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to improve operational efficiency, knowledge management, and transparency while ensuring compliance with privacy and data protection laws. The Academy contributes to this [open-source project](https://github.com/SSC-ICT-Innovatie/LearningLion) by providing research expertise, developing the language model, and ensuring the integration of privacy and security standards.

### [Project Virtual DIVD Environment](#project-virtual-divd)
A [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mV-HLIWmEqj8X2nohaT5iStxRP-4tSsUjD-NCeJtOC0/edit?usp=sharing) has been submitted exploring the use of gamification to increase engagement with the organization. This proposal outlines two separate ideas.

The first idea focuses on increasing participation in activities like providing feedback or generally boosting involvement in organizational initiatives.  This could be achieved through tactics like awarding points or badges for completing specific actions.

The second idea is more ambitious and proposes developing a gamified system that could potentially provide internship opportunities for students. This could involve creating a complex simulation or challenge that students could work on as part of their internship, allowing them to gain practical experience while contributing to the organization.
